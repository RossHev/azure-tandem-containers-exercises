# Challenge 1: Pushing code to Azure DevOps

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./02-connectingtoazure.md)

## Introduction

To get started using AKS with Azure DevOps, the first thing you'll need to do is get your source code uploaded. To help, we've created a repo containing the application code you've been working with along with Kubernetes YAML manifests that should be pretty close to what you've built yourself!

The repo also contains the pipeline code necessary to build and deploy your application, but we'll get to that part later!

## Description
- Start by retrieving the application source code repository from GitHub:
https://github.com/incyclesoftware/azure-tandem-containers-exercise-app

- Create a new repository in Azure DevOps, clone it, and add your source code.

- Once you've committed your code to the repo, push it!

- You'll need to use both the Azure DevOps GUI and the Git CLI to accomplish this!

## Success Criteria

- You have a local copy of the repository
- You have your own repository in Azure DevOps
- You have your local code pushed to Azure DevOps
